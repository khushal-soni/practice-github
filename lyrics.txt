[Verse 1]
I've been defeated and brought down
Oh, dropped to my knees when hope ran out
Oh, the time has come to change my ways

[Refrain]
On this day I see clearly
Everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I'll never long for what might have been
And now regret won't waste my life again
Oh, I won't look back, I'll fight to remain
